Snake in a nutshell? This is a game made in Python playable in the terminal.

## How to play it?

The game is designed to be played with inputs, requiring the player to press Enter after each desired movement. 
If you have any suggestions on how to ensure an Enter instruction is included in every loop iteration, I would appreciate it.
Thanks !
